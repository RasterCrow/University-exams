# OPERATING SYSTEMS project exam at UniUPO

If I understood my code correctly ( I don't have the exam text anymore ), the code should take in input a file with multiple numbers and check for each number all their primes from 0 to number.
It then creates another file with the list of prime numbers found for each n in the original file.

divisoriP uses processes with shared memory.
divisoriT uses threads with mutex.

Missing a custom library we used called xerrors, taht had some helpfull pre made functions.
