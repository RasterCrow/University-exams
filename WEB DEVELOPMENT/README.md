# WEB DEV project exam at UniUPO

I also uploaded some of the exercises we had to do during the course.
The exam project it self is made with php, html,js,css and there is also a small part in java servlet ( the admin side of it ).
It's an Amazon clone, where people can buy, review, and search for items. There is account authentication, cart implementation and if you're an admin you cann add items through the java servlet side of the project.
Therre is obviously also a database made with Postgress.
