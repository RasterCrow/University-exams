# imageManipulator
Exam project I had to make for the university.
A simple image manipulator, you can resize an image, convert it to jpeg, apply filters to it ( blur, sharpening ).
The project itself was the Rotate function, which makes an image rotate at a certain degree and speed.
It also has a simple Double Buffer implementation, which should be solving problems like screen tearing.

I also added to the repo some sampleImages, and final version of those with filters and conversion applied.

There is a document describing the file but it's in italian..
